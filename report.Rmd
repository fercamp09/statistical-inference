Overview
In this project I will investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). I Should use the knowledge learnt in class to relate the normal and gaussian distributions, using averages of random numbers of thosse distributions. It is divides in two parts.

Part 1: Simulation Exercise Instructions
This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
hist(runif(1000))
```

```{r}
mns = NULL
for (i in 1 : 1000) mns = c(mns, mean(runif(40)))
hist(mns)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

Part 2: Basic Inferential Data Analysis Instructions

Simulations: Include English explanations of the simulations you ran, with the accompanying R code. Your explanations should make clear what the R code accomplishes.
Sample Mean versus Theoretical Mean: Include figures with titles. In the figures, highlight the means you are comparing. Include text that explains the figures and what is shown on them, and provides appropriate numbers.
Sample Variance versus Theoretical Variance: Include figures (output from R) with titles. Highlight the variances you are comparing. Include text that explains your understanding of the differences of the variances.
Distribution: Via figures and text, explain how one can tell the distribution is approximately normal.


Review criteria
    Did you show where the distribution is centered at and compare it to the theoretical center of the distribution?
    Did you show how variable it is and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution?
    Did you perform an exploratory data analysis of at least a single plot or table highlighting basic features of the data?
    Did the student perform some relevant confidence intervals and/or tests?
    Were the results of the tests and/or intervals interpreted in the context of the problem correctly?
    Did the student describe the assumptions needed for their conclusions? readRDS(file, refhook = NULL)
